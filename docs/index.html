            Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/thelangbot">@thelangbot</a> that retweets all the tweets that contain the <span class="hashtag">#100DaysOfLanguage</span> and
            <span class="hashtag">#langtwt</span> hashtag. It’s a great way to keep yourself motivated and to participate in the community. Optionally, make sure to take notes in a physical journal to
            reinforce learning concepts. You can download and use
            <a href="https://github.com/maxdemaio/thelangbot/blob/main/app/data/100DayLog.txt">100DayLog.txt</a>
            to track your progress if you'd like.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, please encourage others who are posting their daily updates on their progress. Supporting others helps build and grow a community around positivity and that is helpful and effective.
            Plus, it's more likely that you will stick to your own commitment meeting new friends along the way!
